# google-homepage
Creating my first homepage utilizing  From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css).
Hopefully able to use my skills in HTML and CSS to replicate a webpage already created.
Playing around with Dev tools in the browser.
